st.write("1. This widget shows the temperature trend of different continents over the years. We can select which continent trend we want to view and click 'Get Plot' to get the plot.")
st.write("2. This widget can be used to compare temperatures of different countries at different years. It consists of two sliders using which we can select years, a button which is clicked to get visualizations and two interactive choropleth maps at years selected from sliders.")
st.write("3. This widget consists of time series forecasting which tells us the average land temperature of Earth over the past years and also predicts into the future until 2105. It contains a slider to select year for which we want to see the average land temperature of Earth and a button which updates the visualization. On each update, the marker on the graph will change and point towards the updated information requested.")
